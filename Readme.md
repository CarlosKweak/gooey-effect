#Gooey Example
A quick example to play with a gooey effect using the framer.js library. It's an effect where two shapes kind of _gooey-morph_ into a larger combined shape. This image from css-tricks.com illustrates it well.

###Limitation
This example works best using the Safari browser on a Mac. It sort of works on Chrome, but the full gooey effect is a bit harsh.

###Additional Info
This example is detailed more in a [blog post](http://rohn.ghost.io/gooey-framerjs/) I wrote.
